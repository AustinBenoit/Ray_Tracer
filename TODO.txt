Where I left off. 
Just finished making sure world works
Next up is finish materials and camera

Short term
1. refactor the code split everything out into the right header files
2. Continue materials work
3. Add in other primitives (Box and triangle)
4. continue with camera class implimentation
5. Look at doing build automation and testing in git? Or locally. 
6. Fix sampler and then fix render_ortho_scene
7. Fix multi obj tracer

Long term:
1. Load in meshes
2. Materials
3. Textures
4. AA and sampling
